<h3>In lab2 ：</h3>
We try to match accounts on different platforms which are actually operated by one entity. For example, if you search keyword "原神" on BILIBILI, WEIBO, and some other platforms, you will find its official accounts. They actually all belong to miHoYo, but no one is declaring that they are correlated with each other. Our job is to program a scripts to try to find those accounts automatically.


<h3>In lab3:</h3>
We programed a script to implement AETG algorithms, which support t-way combinations pair searching.( t>=2 and t is an integer)
